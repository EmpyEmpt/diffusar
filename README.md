# Diffusar - image filtration

Image restoration using diffusions!

The plan is to train diffusion model to reconstuct images, remove artifacts, noise etc.

This branch uses ControlNet  
Since it was too expensive to train I've decided to abandon this idead and will use different model  
This (probably and mostly) works for the most part except for maybe a few typos

## How to use

TBA!

## Architecture

ControlNet!
Everything else is TBA!
